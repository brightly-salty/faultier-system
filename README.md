# The Faultier ecosystem

 The following is a rundown of the current state, and goals/purpose of the projects in the Faultier ecosystem.



This is the home repository for a series of projects I'm working on called "Faultier" (German for "sloth"). 

The purpose is to pursue some cool ideas I've been thinking about and to help me learn some new things. It is not meant to be used in real life, though if anyone wants to attempt this, I will do anything I can to help this effort.



Basically, the (very ambitious) idea is to provide a unified ecosystem for innovative projects.



Current projects:

- Operating system: Faultier-OS ([Github](https://github.com/brightly-salty/faultier-os/tree/master))



To-do projects:

- Programming language/scripting language/shell

- Text editor

- Browser
